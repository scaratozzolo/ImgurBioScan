# ImgurBioScan
Some people on Imgur like to add things like "screenshot this and get it to the front page" to their bios. This very basic and crappily thrown together python program attempts to find users and bios like this.

The program uses BeautifulSoup4 to help with scraping webpages and Selenium to load the pages.

To install them:
```
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
$ pip install selenium
```

At the moment it scans the front page to get current gallery images and their uploaders. I'm afraid that when the Imgur front page comes out of beta this will no longer work, so for the time being it's also being used to create a dictionary of Imgur usernames.

This took me a few days to throw together, mostly due to learning how BeautifulSoup and Selenium works, along with PyQt5 in the previous version.

Any questions or concerns feel free to contact me.

######TODO:   maybe
- [x] Fix the number of users being added to UserDict print statement
- [ ] Make inner function of user_scan it'sown function with a num_users arguument
- [ ] Load pickle files at top of script to try and make them actually global because for some reason they're not?
- [x] Save found bios to pickle to compare if they've been printed before, only print new found bios
- [ ] settings and options?
